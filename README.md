# Accident-prevention-system

Accident-prevention-system This project is an accident prevention system designed to maintain a safety features in the automative industry.The system uses sensors to monitor the distance based on the speed of sound.

Features: Continuosly monitors the vehicles speed and distance based on sensor (eg..,HC-SR04).

LCD Display: Dislays the distance to obstacles in a clear and readable format.

Components Required:

-Microcontroller(e.g., Arduino,Raspberry Pi)

-Ultrasonic Sensor(e.g., HC-SR04)

-Motor with Fan

-LCD Display

Connect the circuit as shown in the vedio or image. Make sure you give less suply so that the ardiuno may not blast and also take care of the connections. Maintain good components and set the ultrasonic sensor at the end of board so that we can change the speed and distance easily. Dump the code above in the ardiuno. set a certain cutoff temperature as per your requried conditions.
